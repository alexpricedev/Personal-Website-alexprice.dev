The syntax debates are cute. But they're about to become completely irrelevant.

Every few months, engineers argue passionately about tooling choices. Tailwind vs CSS-in-JS. Tabs vs spaces. This framework vs that one.

Meanwhile, AI is getting smart enough to invent its own shorthand. Its own representations. Its own low-level languages optimised for outcomes, not human readability.

The question "which tools does AI prefer?" misses the point entirely. The answer, very shortly: none of them — at least none that humans will be able to read or use directly.

For founders building engineering teams, this changes the hiring calculus.

The engineers who'll matter aren't the ones who can write elegant code. They're the ones who are experts in defining and communicating outcomes.

That's a fundamentally different skill set. And it's the difference between building a team that becomes obsolete and building one that rides this wave.

When I help founders hire their first senior engineers or evaluate technical leadership, this is increasingly what we're filtering for: outcome definition, not syntax mastery.
