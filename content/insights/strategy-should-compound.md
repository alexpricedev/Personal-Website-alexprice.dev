The best strategies aren't about hitting targets. They're about making future targets easier to hit.

The founders I've worked with who scale get this. Those who don't, don't.

They're not optimising for this quarter. They're optimising for the end-game.

Asking questions like:

- What process improvements will save us a hundred hours next quarter?
- What relationships can we invest in today that will open doors in two years?
- What decisions today set us up for an exit in five years?

If your strategy doesn't answer these, it needs another iteration.
