excerpt: "After two exits and scaling teams from 3 to 80+ FTEs, I realised the best thing I could do was stop staying."

The first time I made myself unnecessary, it felt like failure.

I'd spent 18 months building the engineering org at Ecologi. We'd gone from 3 staff to over 80. We had a real platform, real customers, and a team that could ship without me in every room.

And that's when I knew it was time to go.

## The uncomfortable truth about CTO roles

Most CTOs stay too long. They build empires instead of systems. They become bottlenecks instead of enablers.

I know because I've done it. Early in my career, I measured success by how much the team needed me. Every decision that required my input felt like validation.

That's backwards.

## What good looks like

The best thing a technical leader can do is build something that doesn't need them. That means:

- Hiring people smarter than you in their domains
- Creating systems that make good decisions easy
- Getting out of the way

## Why fractional works

Now I help founders do what I wish I'd done faster: build teams and systems that don't create dependency.

I come in, figure out what's broken, fix it or hire someone who will, and leave.

No empire building. No extended retainers. Just results.
