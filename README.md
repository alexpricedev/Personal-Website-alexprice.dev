# Alex Price – Fractional CTO

Fractional CTO for Series A startups who need to move fast and get it right.

## About

I help founders build engineering teams that scale – without the cost and risk of a full-time CTO hire.

I co-founded and was CTO at [Ecologi](https://ecologi.com) where we scaled from 3 to 80+ employees, had 18,000 happy B2B customers, and ranked #8 in LinkedIn's Top UK Startups 2022. After my exit, I became CTO at [Just](https://justabout.com), taking a pre-alpha concept to production.

Now I work with Series A founders as a fractional CTO.

## How I Work

**Embedded support** – One to two days per week until you're ready to hire permanently.

**Transformation projects** – Focused three-month engagements for team structure, hiring, or tech strategy.
